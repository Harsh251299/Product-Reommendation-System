# **Product Recommendation-System**
A product recommendation is basically a filtering system that seeks to predict and show the items that a user would like to purchase. 

It may not be entirely accurate, but if it shows you what you like then it is doing its job right.

Recommender systems have become increasingly popular in recent years and are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general.

And widely used in E- commerce sites like Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Myntra etc.

## Types of Filtering Systems
**1. Content – based filtering.**

  Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences.

  Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's      features.

  To create a user profile, the system mostly focuses on two types of information:- 

	    1. A model of the user's preference.
	    
	    2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.

**2. Collaborative filtering.**

 Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past. 
 
The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items.

One of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by “Amazon.com’s” recommender system.

Many social networks originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends.
